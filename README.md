# PlugMan
plugin manager for both neovim and tmux (for now)

this is still work in progress, it doesn't yet work, and it is nowhere near being ready for everyday use
this script relies on a .txt file that contains the names of the plugins followed by a space then the link for the plugin
so far I've only written one for neovim and it only contains a handful of plugins, it's only used for testing
feel free to add any plugins you want to the text files, and please do help me in this project (if you can), I am still relativly new to programming
and barely have time
if you want to donate here is my btc address, don't feel obliged to do so
